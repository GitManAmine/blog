# Introduction 

First, what is `Docker` ?

*`Docker` is a `containerization` technology that allows running isolated applications in containers.*

*`Containers` package applications along with their dependencies and libraries, making it easy to deploy and run them. With Docker, you can execute various versions of `Linux distributions`, applications, and services like web servers, databases, and programming languages.*

*It simplifies application deployment by including everything needed to run the application within the container. `Docker` revolutionizes `application` deployment and management, offering flexibility, isolation, and efficient resource `utilization`.*
